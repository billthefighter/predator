This project is an art project and an opportunity to lean openCV. 

The software will do the following:

1. process an incoming video stream to highlight differences between frames and leave a trail of motion
2. Identify faces in raw video stream
3. Display processed video stream onto a display
4. Use stepper motors in a gantry to move a magnifying glass over the faces displayed on the display
